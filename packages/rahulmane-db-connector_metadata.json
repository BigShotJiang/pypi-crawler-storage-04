  "license": "**2. `LICENSE`**\r\n        For the `LICENSE` file, a simple choice is the MIT License. Go to [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/), copy the text, and paste it into your `LICENSE` file. Remember to replace `[year]` and `[fullname]`.\r\n        \r\n        ---\r\n        \r\n        ### Step 5: Build Your Package\r\n        \r\n        Now you're ready to create the distribution files that will be uploaded to PyPI.\r\n        \r\n        1.  **Install build tools:**\r\n            ```bash\r\n            pip install build twine\r\n            ```\r\n            *   `build` is the tool that builds your package.\r\n            *   `twine` is the tool that securely uploads it.\r\n        \r\n        2.  **Run the build command:**\r\n            In your project's root directory (`simple-db-connector/`), run:\r\n            ```bash\r\n            python -m build\r\n            ```\r\n        \r\n        You will see a lot of output, and two new folders will be created: `build/` and `dist/`. The `dist/` folder contains your package files ready for distribution:\r\n        *   `simple_db_connector_lib-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` (a wheel file, the modern format)\r\n        *   `simple-db-connector-lib-0.1.0.tar.gz` (a source archive, for fallback)\r\n        \r\n        ---\r\n        \r\n        ### Step 6: Deploy to PyPI\r\n        \r\n        This is the final step! We will first upload to TestPyPI (a test server) to make sure everything works, then to the real PyPI.\r\n        \r\n        1.  **Create Accounts:**\r\n            *   Go to [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/account/register/) and create an account.\r\n            *   Go to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/account/register/) and create an account. **Use a different password.**\r\n        \r\n        2.  **Upload to TestPyPI:**\r\n            This is a sandbox for testing your package deployment.\r\n            ```bash\r\n            twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*\r\n            ```\r\n            Twine will prompt you for your TestPyPI username and password.\r\n        \r\n        3.  **Test Your Package from TestPyPI:**\r\n            Create a new virtual environment and try to install your package from the test server.\r\n            ```bash\r\n            # Create and activate a new virtual environment\r\n            python -m venv testenv\r\n            source testenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: testenv\\Scripts\\activate\r\n        \r\n            # Install from TestPyPI\r\n            pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps simple-db-connector-lib\r\n            ```\r\n            Now, run a Python script to test if the import works. If it does, your package is correctly built!\r\n        \r\n        4.  **Upload to Real PyPI:**\r\n            Once you're confident it works, upload it to the official PyPI.\r\n            ```bash\r\n            twine upload dist/*\r\n            ```\r\n            This time, enter your official PyPI username and password.\r\n        \r\n        **Congratulations!** Your library is now live on PyPI. Anyone in the world can install it by running:\r\n        \r\n        ```bash\r\n        pip install simple-db-connector-lib ",
