You may add Your own attribution\r\n              notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\r\n              or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\r\n              that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\r\n              as modifying the License.\r\n        \r\n           You may add Your own copyright notice to Your modifications and\r\n           may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\r\n           for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\r\n           for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\r\n           reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\r\n           the conditions stated in this License.\r\n        \r\n           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\r\n              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\r\n              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\r\n              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\r\n              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\r\n              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\r\n              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n        \r\n           6.

However, in\r\n              accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and\r\n              on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,\r\n              and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor\r\n              harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,\r\n              such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or\r\n              support.\r\n        \r\n           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n        \r\n           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\r\n        \r\n              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\r\n              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\r\n              replaced with your own identifying information.
